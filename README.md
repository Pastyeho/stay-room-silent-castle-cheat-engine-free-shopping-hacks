Stay Room Silent Castle cheats engine free shopping hacks gems glitch - These turrets are cheap, but not enough to effectively send spam early in the game without sacrificing the most important door. After upgrading to the "bed" again, it becomes feasible to upgrade the turret to the second level. The turret was originally in the form of a broom, but it was eventually replaced by a shovel, a power hose, and an exorcism bubble blower filled with holy water, giving you firepower, but they were weak enough in the early days. You'd better make only one or two of them and upgrade once in the early days of the game. You'll find yourself throwing everything else on the door and bed until the bed is upgraded enough to make turret spam and upgrades a problem. Once you can set up the turret trash door, and there is a decent door in front of it (probably a level 5 steel door), immediately upgrade them at least once to improve the range. silent castle glitch silent castle free purchase
